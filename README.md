# stack
This is a simple clone of the well known "Stack" game on Android.

I developed this with the sole purpose of learning some Unity coding.

It's a pretty basic implementation, but the code is all here for anyone else to reference.

Play it here [Android App store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Telecoda.Stack)
